read config from zip file 
make this configurable:
screen rgb
dpi

and make this testable too:
xml parser (custom tabs/layouts, theme when libaroma is mature enough)
json parser? (idk how)
dialog (fix it pls)
fragment
toast (when finished)

LAYOUT:
[status bar]
	time, battery, charger connection
[sidebar]
	not sure what to add here
	aroma logo
	test selector?
	about dialog
	exit button :P
[appbar]
	settable by some page
[fragment]
	[list? might be button selector, if I adapt the transition animation to also animate width]
		1) pager:
			1) list sample with different options
			2) pager swipe animation selector (option items)
			3) list decorations and overscroll effect (switch/options)
		2) appbar mode selection & text gap toggle
